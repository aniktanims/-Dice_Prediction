# ðŸŽ² Dice Prediction ML

A refined Python machine learning application that predicts the next outcome of a **three-dice roll** using historical roll data. Employing advanced algorithms and a large dataset, this model identifies patterns and predicts future results with improved accuracy and interpretability.

---

##  Features

- **History-based prediction** of three-dice rolls using ML algorithms.  
- Supports multiple modeling strategies (e.g., Random Forest, ensembles).  
- Trained on extensive datasets for reliability and pattern detection.  
- Modular codebaseâ€”easy to extend and integrate into other workflows.  
- Ideal for probability analysis, simulations, academic exploration, and more.

##  Installation & Setup

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aniktanims/Dice_Prediction.git
cd Dice_Prediction
````

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Run the prediction script through the command line:

```bash
python predict.py --input data/history.csv
```

### Example options:

* `--model randomforest` â€” Use Random Forest model.
* `--verbose` â€” Enable detailed logging for diagnostics.
* `--output predictions.csv` â€” Save prediction results to file.

---

## Dataset Format

Expected CSV structure:

| dice1 | dice2 | dice3 | total |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 3     | 2     | 6     | 11    |

* **dice1**, **dice2**, **dice3**: Individual dice results.
* **total**: Optional; auto-corrected if mismatched.

---

## Architecture Description

The core predictive model leverages:

* **Random Forest** for robust classification.
* **Ensemble techniques** combining probabilistic and statistical metrics.
* **Bias adjustment** and fairness evaluation (e.g., via Dirichlet distributions and runs test).
* **Optionally**, support for continuous learning via online or batch updates.
